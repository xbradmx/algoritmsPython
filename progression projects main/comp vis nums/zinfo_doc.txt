Great! Let's start implementing the mathematical operations. We'll build this step by step.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

**Create your project structure:**
```
digit_recognition/
├── data.py          # Data loading and preprocessing
├── network.py       # Neural network implementation
├── train.py         # Training loop
└── main.py          # Main execution file
```

## Step 2: Understanding the Data Flow

**The Mathematical Pipeline:**
1. **Input**: 784 numbers (28×28 pixels flattened)
2. **Hidden Layer**: Transform input through weighted connections
3. **Output Layer**: 10 numbers (probabilities for each digit 0-9)
4. **Prediction**: The highest probability is our guess

**Key Mathematical Formulas:**
- **Linear Transformation**: `output = input × weights + bias`
- **Activation Function**: `activated_output = activation_function(output)`
- **Loss Function**: `loss = -log(probability_of_correct_class)`

## Step 3: First Implementation - Data Structure

**What you need to create in `data.py`:**

**Functions to implement:**
1. `load_mnist()` - Download and load the dataset
2. `preprocess_data()` - Normalize pixel values (0-255 → 0-1)
3. `one_hot_encode()` - Convert labels (5 → [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0])
4. `create_batches()` - Group data for efficient training

**Key preprocessing steps:**
- Flatten images from 28×28 to 784×1 vectors
- Normalize pixel values to 0-1 range
- Convert labels to one-hot encoding
- Shuffle data for better training

## Step 4: Network Architecture Design

**What you need to create in `network.py`:**

**Class structure:**
```
class NeuralNetwork:
    - __init__(): Initialize weights and biases
    - forward(): Make predictions
    - backward(): Calculate gradients
    - update_weights(): Apply learning
    - train(): Training loop
    - predict(): Make single predictions
```

**Weight initialization strategy:**
- Start with small random numbers
- Use specific ranges to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients
- Initialize biases to zero

## Step 5: Core Mathematical Functions

**Functions you'll implement:**

1. **Activation Functions:**
   - ReLU: `max(0, x)` - simple and effective
   - Softmax: converts outputs to probabilities

2. **Forward Pass:**
   - Matrix multiplication between layers
   - Apply activation functions
   - Pass data through each layer

3. **Loss Calculation:**
   - Cross-entropy loss for classification
   - Measures difference between prediction and actual label

4. **Backpropagation:**
   - Calculate how much each weight contributed to the error
   - Use chain rule to propagate errors backward

## Step 6: Your Implementation Tasks

**Start with these specific functions:**

1. **In `data.py`:**
   - Function to load MNIST data
   - Function to normalize images
   - Function to create training batches

2. **In `network.py`:**
   - Initialize network with random weights
   - Implement forward pass (prediction)
   - Implement simple loss calculation

**Architecture to start with:**
- Input: 784 neurons (flattened 28×28 image)
- Hidden layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output: 10 neurons with softmax activation

**Testing your progress:**
- Can you load and display an MNIST image?
- Can you pass data through your network and get 10 output values?
- Do the output values sum to 1 (if using softmax)?

Ready to start implementing? Which component would you like to tackle first - data loading or the basic network structure? I'll guide you through the concepts and logic for whichever you choose.
